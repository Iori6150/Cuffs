OpenNC Readme - Version 3.950+ 2014/03/06

ATTENTION: This cuffset is made to be used with OpenCollar Version 3.940 or above. The Addon does not support collars of a lower version anymore,  

The cuffs can keep the same colors and textures as the collar (if same labels for prims are used) and share owners. Furthermore they can be locked and unlocked from the collar. 

Additionally the arm and leg cuffs can be locked in several positions,. When using those animations Lockmeister compatible AOs will be disabled for the time being, the OpenCollar SubAO will be switched off and back on as needed. Other AOs might override the arm position; in this case we recommend switching off the AO or using the OpenCollar Sub AO.

Please report any bugs and problems with this release to  North Glenwalker

INSTALLATION:
The cuffs can be worn simply and be clicked to show a menu. or type <pre>cmenu from the command line. If you want to keep the colors and textures as well as owners in sync with the collar, you have to place the script found in this folder into your OpenCollar collar. The plug-in will as well allow you to open the Cuff menu from the OpenCollar menu.

To install this into your collar:
1) make sure you have a copy of your current collar. The collar needs to be minimum Version 3.900. With lower version it will NOT work.
2) wear your collar (unlocked when using rlv, else you cannot edit it)
3) go into edit, click more , open the content tab
4) be patient !!!!
5) If you have an older version of the Cuff plugin installed: wait until you see the content, look for OpenCollar - cuffs - 3.xxx, delete it.
6) be patient, wait until the content refreshed this may take a while
7) drag the script OpenCollar - OpenCollar - cuffs - 3.940  into the content tab

Thanks go out to Anne Karas (inital communications and poses system), Pol McLaglen (starting the project and initial cuff design), Jesrad Seraph (additional poses), Winter Seale (some script improvements and bug fixings), Sandra Merilouto (testing) and Garvin Twine (testing and advise). Don’t forget Athaliah Opus and Nandana Singh, who started that OC madness and the mayn scripter involved in the OC project, on which this cuffs scripts are based on. You rock! 

New 3.950 cuff code by North Glenwalker, building on the work of the above team.

Thanks as well for all who contributed and are not mentioned here. We hope, you like the cuffs and enjoy playing with them.

The cuffs use the LockMeister protocol by Kyrah Abattoir, which is under GPL3. Find more infos here: http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LSL_Protocol/LockMeister_System.
The cuffs use the  LockGuard V2 System Protocol by Lillani Lowell.

OpenCollar/OpenNC is a set of scripts for a collar similar to other collars common in SL.  Unlike those systems however, OpenNC is open source.  You are free to copy and redistribute the OpenNC scripts, provided that you leave them full perms.  Read the entire OpenNC License in the notecard accompanying the scripts.

The OpenCollar/OpenNC architecture is plug in-based, allowing for many more features to be added in the future.  Features not found in other collars include:

- complete, menu-driven support for the Restrained Life Viewer.
- optional Group control (in addition to owners and secowners)
- menu-driven color and texture setting
- and best of all,  open source!

Please report any bugs you find or feature requests to North Glenwalker


Note to developers:

Scripts beginning with OpenNC are specific to the Cuffs. They show the last version they have been modified in.
There are scripts in sub prims for the chaining to work. Please read the designer guide to get more infos.
If you want to allow the colors/textures of the cuffs and collar be kept in sync, you have to make sure the prims share the same names.
